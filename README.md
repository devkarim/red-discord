# RED Discord Bot

## Overview

RED is a very narcissist discord bot that only obeys his founders and automates a few important daily tasks. The bot is listed private only to his founder (me üòÄ) for now meaning you can't invite it to your server yet.

## Features

RED has limited features for now. Features are:

- Tells you islamic prayer times based on your city with interactive buttons. Supports 3 cities in Egypt: Cairo (my city ‚ù§Ô∏è), Mansoura (worst city ü§¢) and Al-Ismailia (mango city ü•≠).

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Discord.js
- Other utility dependencies

## How to Run (if you care)

You can run this discord bot on your device but it requires a few environment variables to be considered in your .env file:

```
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=<Your-Discord-Client-ID>
DISCORD_TOKEN=<Your-Discord-Token>
DISCORD_DEV_GUILD_ID=<Your-Discord-Development-Server-ID>
ENV=<production/development>
```

Don't share these environment variables with anybody! Only share with me ‚ù§Ô∏è

Start by cloning this repository via:
`git clone https://github.com/devkarim/red-discord.git`

Then navigate to the repo folder and install all dependencies via `yarn` or `npm install`. To run, you can either use `yarn dev` for development or `yarn start` for production. Don't forget to include the enviornment variables as said above.

## Scripts

This project includes a few useful scripts that may help you with development:

- deploy-cmds: Deploys slash commands to your discord development server id.
- watch: Watches for changes inside "src" folder then restarts the discord bot accordingly.
- build: Compiles the discord bot from TypeScript to JavaScript into "/build" folder.
